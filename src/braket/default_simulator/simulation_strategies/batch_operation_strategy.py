def apply_operations(
    state: np.ndarray, qubit_count: int, operations: List[GateOperation], batch_size: int
) -> np.ndarray:
    r"""Combines consecutive operations on the same targets and applies them in batches.

    First, consecutive operations on the same target qubits are combined into single unitary gates.

    For example::

        |0> -[H]-[X]------[YY]-[ZZ]-
                           |    |
        |1> -[X]--@--[XX]--|----|---
                  |   |    |    |
        |2> -----[X]-[XX]-[YY]-[ZZ]-

    becomes::

        |0> -[X * H]-----------[ZZ * YY]-
                                   |
        |1> ---[X]---[XX * CX]-----|-----
                         |         |
        |2> ---------[XX * CX]-[ZZ * YY]-

    (the gates are reversed in each group because matrices are multiplied right to left)

    The combined operations are then partitioned into contiguous batches of size ``batch_size``
    (with remainder). The state vector is treated as a type :math:`(qubit\_count, 0)` tensor,
    and each operation is treated as a type :math:`(target\_length, target\_length)` tensor
    (where :math:`target\_length` is the number of targets the operation acts on), and each batch
    is contracted in an order optimized among the operations in the batch.

    For example, if we have a 4-qubit state :math:`S` and a batch with two gates :math:`G1` and
    :math:`G2` that act on qubits 0 and 1 and 1 and 3, respectively, then the state vector after
    applying the batch is :math:`S^{mokp} = S^{ijkl} G1^{mn}_{ij} G2^{op}_{nl}`.

    Depending on the batch size, number of qubits, and the number and types of gates, the speed can
    be more than twice that of applying operations one at a time, but memory use will increase.
    Empirically, noticeable performance improvements were observed starting with a batch size of 10,
    with increasing performance gains up to a batch size of 50. We tested this with 16 GB of memory.
    For batch sizes greater than 50, consider using an environment with more than 16 GB of memory.

    Args:
        state (np.ndarray): The state vector to apply :math:`operations` to, as a type
            :math:`(qubit\_count, 0)` tensor
        qubit_count (int): The number of qubits in the state
        operations (List[GateOperation]): The operations to apply to the state vector
        batch_size: The number of operations to contract in each batch

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: The state vector after applying the given operations, as a type
        (num_qubits, 0) tensor
